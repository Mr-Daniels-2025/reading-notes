                                Understanding a Few Basics about Markdown

Language is one way humans communicate.  In the computer world, “Markdown” is one basic language humans use to communicate with others in that world. When we use “Markdown” to communicate with others, we often use it within a platform called “GitHub.”

To better understand the “Markdown” language, we usually consider a few key things:

1.	Markdown is one way (or language used) to style text that will appear on websites. 
2.	When we use it, we control the display of the document it will help produce.
a.	For example, we can format words as bold or italic.
b.	We can also use it to add in images or lists of text and other things to a webpage or document.
3.	When we create a product with “Markdown”, we are just writing regular text along with a few characters like the “#” or “*” signs.

Now that we understand more about “Markdown”, let’s remember that it is written on something. Instead of writing it on sheet of paper, we write it in what’s called a “plain-text editor.”  Once it is written, we can save it in a place like “GitHub” (which is an online platform for storing written computer code/information).
