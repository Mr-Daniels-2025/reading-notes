                                                               Choosing a Text Editor

A text editor is a simple tool that allows you to write and manage text. It edits text—“so what?”, one may ask.  The answer to that is simple:  It is one of the main tools we use to write code—code that builds a website.  Ultimately, the “so what” answer is that websites propel global business and vital day-to-day operations.

What features should you look for in choosing a text editor?  Common things to consider include:

•	code completion (which displays possible suggestions as you type);

•	syntax highlighting (which colorizes text to support efficiency);

•	a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 

•	available extensions (or “plugins” that enable “superpowers”).


There are many other features but these four are a nice start to supporting productivity.  Coders typically add more features to their editors as they gain experience.  Therefore, the key thing to remember is that an editor (and its extensions) should support you in accomplishing more with minimal effort.  It adds functionality as you need it.

Some of the more popular text editors include software like:  Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.  They all have similar features with slightly unique extensions.  One rule of thumb for choosing one is to try several and pick the one that “feels the best.”  Your choice will likely mirror those most common in the web development community.  It all boils down to what you enjoy using the most; and will it help you (efficiently) create an entire website?
